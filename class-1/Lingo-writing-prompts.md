<b>Write about two kinds of HTTP requests you make in your daily life.</b>
HTTP requests include get, post, delete, or put. I use the "get" type most often, for example when I open Facebook to see the funny memes my friends have posted.

<b>What is the JavaScript console?</b>The console is the JavaScript programming that controls how things work. Using the console you can change how the programming on a website functions. This is how we were able to alter the online-game Floppy Bird to make it easier (even cheating I couldn't get past a score of 2, though) by changing gravity and other aspects of the game.
