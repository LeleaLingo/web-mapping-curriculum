Marina and I have examined the data and think we might scale back our project: we intend mainly to compare the extent of the fires as compared to the ground cover.

As for building, there's no code yet, but we know we want an interactive map which overlays the data for both ground cover and fire boundaries to show the potential correlation.

The most significant obstacle we need to overcome is understanding where to start with building the map. Both of us feel like we could begin the work within ArcGIS, but are stumped as to where to begin without it!
