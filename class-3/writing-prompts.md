<H1> Writing Prompts
<H2>Intro to interactivity

<b>What are some strategies interactive map developers can use to ensure maps with a lot of interactions are not overwhelming?</b>

<br>
<b>Why do we use the term “map user” instead of “map reader?”</b>

<br>
<b>Common types of interaction</b>

What is geocoding and how might you add it to an interactive map?
Intro to events

What is an event?
Describe an example of how you could use an event listener with an interactive map.
Code exercises to do on your own (10 points):
Starting from your marker-and-popup map, add a button that, when clicked, causes the map to fly to Walla Walla, Washington. To turn this assignment in, commit a new file called "fly-to.html" to the "class 3" folder in your personal class repo.
Hint
Create popups that include information about the clicked feature. Starting from this starter file, attempt to address each of the [Prompt] comments, including any sub-prompts that follow. Once you have made your edits, save your changes and commit the file to your personal class repo. This will be a challenging exercise and we don't expect everyone to build a completely working map. For any prompts you get stuck on, you can still get full credit by including, at a minimum:
Pseudo code describing what you think needs to happen.
At least one code snippet showing what you attempted.
Links to any resources you found while researching.
