<H2>Intro to interactivity</h2>

<b>What are some strategies interactive map developers can use to ensure maps with a lot of interactions are not overwhelming?</b>
Interactive map developers need to keep in mind what information they are trying to provide map users, and should not just add interactions because they are fun or shiny. Interactions can be very helpful for a map user, but too many will detract from the sharing of data. Map developers also need to keep in mind if the user will be mainly using mobile or computers since they have very different real estate.
<br>
<b>Why do we use the term “map user” instead of “map reader?”</b>
Interactive maps provide ways for people to interact with map data by clicking, using searches, turning on layers, etc. They are actually using the map as opposed to traditional cartography where map readers had to interpret a static map.
<br>
<h2>Common types of interaction</h2>
<b>What is geocoding and how might you add it to an interactive map? </b>
Geocoding is the process of associating names or tags to spatial data, for example, having addresses on a map correspond to buisnesses or polygons on a map associated with park names, etc. Depending on the map or style of project, you could associate almost anything with spatial data, and that would be geocoding.

<h2>Intro to events</h2>
<b>What is an event? </b>
An event is something that happens on a map. A combination of buttons pressed, a click in a certain location, etc. The events are identified in code and event listeners wait for the event to take place.
<br>
<b>Describe an example of how you could use an event listener with an interactive map.</b>
Event listeners are also part of code, and once an event occurs, it makes something happen, like a pop up, or highlighting certain features, or whatever the programer decides should happen. You could use it to say if a user clicks on a street (the event), the listener would then trigger a popup to show what the name of the street is along with other information.
