<h2>Runtime styling</h2>
<b>What do we mean when we talk about a program’s “lifecycle?”</b>
It is the stages a program goes through as it progresses through the coding.

<h2>Lesson recap</h2>
<b>In JavaScript, what is a function and when might you want to create one?</b>
A function is an action. You would create a function instead of just running an action if you will repeatedly run the same or similar action and want to have a pre-set function with all of the available code ready to go.
<br>
<b>In CSS, what is the difference between a class and an id?</b>
Classes start with . and ids start with #. IDs are used to label an element where as a class can be used for various elements.
<br>
<b>In HTML, does the order of elements matter? Why? </b>
No, because the HTML is just providing the overall stucture for the website. Order matters in the CSS.
<br>
<b>When might you need to use an array? How about an object?</b>
An array can store multiple pieces of data (for example, a list). Objects can be controlled individually to produce the user-end result you would like. Using an object isolates the programming to that specific object and is not applied to other objects (unless you want it to).
